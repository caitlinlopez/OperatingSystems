Title: Lab 2
Description: These are my observations for each part of the lab


Step 1, 2, & 3
* Returns “Segmentation fault (core dumped)”
   * this is because you’re running the program without passing in the input it needs


Step 4
* The delay of 500 makes the output print faster and 5000 makes it slower


Step 5
* printed:
   *  parent id: 23577
      child id: 23578 ; parent id: 23577
      child id: 23580 ; parent id: 1
      child id: 23581 ; parent id: 1
      child id: 23579 ; parent id: 1
      child id: 23585 ; parent id: 1
      child id: 23586 ; parent id: 1

Step 6
   * printed threads 0-5, then 0-49, then 6-99, and then 73-99
